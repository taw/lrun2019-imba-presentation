# Imba
or why React is a bad React

---
# WTF is Imba

React in Coffeescript (_Kinda_)
* Except 10x Better
* And 100x Faster

---
### Before React - Javascript

Javascript was ðŸ’©
* Most people coded in "jQuery Language"

Coffeescript took kitchen sink approach
* Big improvement
* At what cost?

---
### Before React - Frameworks

* New framework every week
* Did you know there are two js frameworks called svelte?
  * [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev)
  * [sveltejs.com](http://sveltejs.com/)
* 50 Shades of Model View Controller
  * Real Models require OOP
  * Real Controller lives on the server
  * View is the only part that makes sense

---
### React Won Framework Wars

* Dropped MVC
* Very simple with minimal learning curve
* Focused on simpler problem of doing Views well
* Embraced transpilation
  * Without going full Coffeescript
  * ES6 took half of Coffeescript and made JS tolerable
* Endorsed by Facebook
* [Angular committed suicide on camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNmWybAyBHI)
  * It was absolutely glorious and unprecedented in history of tech

---
### Reactive Paradigm

* Tree of Components
  * Some HTML elements
  * Some application specific
* Each component declaratively describes its children
* Props go down
* Events go up
* Some Components have State
* Nothing about Models and Controllers here
* Sprinkling of transpilation to make `render` functions look nice

---
### React is a bad React

If this is what React is trying to do, it's failing hard.

---
### Events go up

Good way:
```javascript
  this.trigger("setTheme", {theme: "dark"})
```
Browsers have perfectly good event bubbling.
```javascript
  onSetTheme(event, payload) { ... }
```

---
### Events go up

React way:
* React was created during JS callback insanity period
* Embraced callback hell
* JS moved to promises, `async`/`await` etc.

It fails so hard:
* Extremely verbose
* Any element in between needs a lot of `onfoo=this.props.onfoo`
* Many people give up and just use global state with Redux/MobX etc.
  * `.bind(this)` for extra ðŸ’© on top

---
### Angularization of React

Good way:
* Very simple with minimal learning curve
* _If you have to write React, I recommend sticking to classic style with classes_

React way:
* 100+ ways to write components
* New ways added every release
* Latest are hooks, but more coming for sure
* Initial simplicity is all gone
* Redux ecosystem makes it order of magnitude worse

---
### Components have State

Good way:
```javascript
this.state.todos[index].done = true
```

React way:
```javascript
this.setState(prevState => ({
  todos: [
    ...prevState.todos.slice(0, index),
    {...prevState.todos[index], done: true},
    ...prevState.todos.slice(index + 1),
  ]
}))
```

This is not even standard JS.

`immerjs` makes it somewhat tolerable

---
### Components have State

Good way:
* Local state on relevant components

Redux way:
* Ridiculous amount of extra complexity
* To hide that it's all basically global variables

---
### `render` functions

Good way:
```javascript
if (todos.length === 0) {
  <div>Nothing to do</div>
} else {
  <ul>
    for(let item in todos) {
      <li>{ item }</li>
    }
  </ul>
}
```

React way:
```javascript
{ (todos.length === 0) ? (
  <div>Nothing to do</div>
  ) : (
  <ul>{ todos.map(item => (
    <li>{ item }</li>
  ))}</ul>)
}
```

---
### `render` functions

Beyond very simple cases, turns into hellscape of
* `{{}}`
* `(())`
* `?:`
* `=>`
* `.bind(this)`

Contender for the worst looking templating language ever.

---
### React Performance

React is "fast enough", i.e. fairly slow.

Two DOM trees and careful synchronization between them.

Fake immutability makes it a lot slower.

Redux makes it a lot slower.

---
### Imba

Sort of:
* React-style framework
* on top of Coffeescript-like language

Solves all problems mentioned.

At what cost?

---
### Imba Hello World

```imba
tag App
  def render
    <self>
      <header>
        "Hello, world!"

Imba.mount <App>
```

---
### Imba Performance

Imba is _hilariously_ fast.

Imba doesn't bother tracking state.

Imba just rerenders the whole page on *every browser event*.

Single tree of memoized DOM.

All video games render this way.

---
### Imba Events

* Bubble up like normal browser events
* Zero callback hell
* `trigger` emits event
* `onX` catches them or they keep bubbling up
* Or handle inline inside `render` function
* Works for builtin and custom events

```imba
tag CellTag < svg:g
  def onclick
    data:state = !data:state
    trigger("pause")
```

```imba
<button :tap.pause>
  "Pause"
```

---
### Imba `render` function
```imba
def render
  <self.todoList>
    <h2>
      title
    <form.todo :submit.addTodo>
      <input[@newTodo] placeholder="What's next?">
      <button type="submit">
        "ADD"
    <ul>
      for item in data
        <TodoItem[item]>
    if anyDoneItems
      <button :tap.cleanupDone>
        "Clean up DONE"
```

---
### Comparison

From "A RealWorld Comparison of Front-End Frameworks with Benchmarks (2019 update)"

Imba 627 LOC.

---
### But at what cost?

Coffeescript variant, not even plain Coffeescript.

Own class system at its core.

Going very far with things like `:` vs `.` etc.

Lacks many ES5/ES6 features like getters/setters, destructuring etc.

A lot of minor issues.

---
### Future

My perfect scenario would be someone creating something Imba-like on top of ES6 class system.

---
### Alternatives

Coffeescript 2 + React
* A bit more mainstream language
* `render()` looks nicer
* All other React problems

Opal + Hyperstack (basically React)
* Opal is 90% like regular Ruby
* All other React problems
* Ruby - JS interop is hard

Other Memoized DOM (glimmerjs)
* Separate templating language for views
* ES6 for everything else

Imba 2
* experimental branch
* a few steps towards ES6
